📝 Recent Projects <br/>

<a href="https://github.com/tw1270/Drowsiness-Detection" target="_blank">Drowsiness-Detection Using Neural Network</a>
- Obtained eye image data set from three sources (Kaggle, Nanjing University, and University of Massachusetts)
- Implemented OpenCv to detect eyes and evaluate neural network model using CNN to predict if the eye is closed or not
- Built a program that accesses the user’s webcam to detect if the user is drowsy and achieve a 98.13% accuracy using CNN

<a href="https://github.com/tw1270/Chatbot" target="_blank">Chatbot Using DeepLearning</a>
- Created my own data/intents for the Apple FAQ chatbot
- Transformed and preprocessed the text by tokenizing and lemmatizing it
- Converted the preprocessed text to binary for the model to understand it 
- Implemented Deep Neural Network to train the model 
- Built another Chatbot using Rasa Framework to further improve the chatbot usage

<a href="https://github.com/tw1270/Web-APIs-and-Predicting-Subreddit" target="_blank">Classification model with NLP to distinguish between subreddit post on Reddit
</a>
- Created an unstructured dataset by scraping 4000 comments and posts
- Transformed data in preparation for modeling using feature engineering and natural language processing
- Preprocessed the data using lemmatizing and regularization
